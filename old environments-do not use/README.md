# Old Environment Files - DO NOT USE

This folder contains legacy environment implementations that are no longer in use.

## Current Environment
The game now uses **`direct-model-environment.js`** (located in the root directory) which includes:
- DRACO loader support for compressed GLB files
- Optimized performance
- Dense urban environment with proper building placement
- Enhanced African color themes

## Legacy Files (Archived)
- `environment.js` - Original basic environment
- `enhanced-environment.js` - First enhanced version
- `town-environment.js` - Town scene approach
- `optimized-urban-environment.js` - Performance optimization attempt
- `pack-based-urban-environment.js` - Building pack approach
- `reliable-urban-environment.js` - Manual building creation
- `road-based-environment.js` - Road corridor approach
- `structured-urban-environment.js` - Urban planning approach

## Why These Are Archived
- Performance issues
- Missing DRACO loader support
- Complex maintenance
- Less optimal building placement
- Superseded by the current direct model approach

**Note**: These files are kept for reference only and should not be used in the current game.
