# Legacy Environment Files

This folder contains **8 unused environment files** that were moved here to clean up the main project directory.

## 📁 Files Moved Here:
- `environment.js` - Original basic environment
- `enhanced-environment.js` - Enhanced version with better features  
- `optimized-urban-environment.js` - Urban optimization attempt
- `pack-based-urban-environment.js` - Pack-based loading system
- `reliable-urban-environment.js` - Reliability-focused version
- `road-based-environment.js` - Road-centric environment
- `structured-urban-environment.js` - Structured urban approach
- `town-environment.js` - Town-themed environment

## 🎯 Currently Active Environment:
**`direct-model-environment.js`** (located in main directory)

## 🧹 Purpose of This Cleanup:
- **Reduced confusion** - Only one environment file in main directory
- **Cleaner project structure** - Easy to find the active environment
- **Preserved development history** - All versions saved for reference
- **Easier maintenance** - No accidental edits to wrong files

## 🗑️ Future Cleanup:
These files can be **safely deleted** once the game is finalized and no longer needed for reference.
